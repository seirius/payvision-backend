# Payvision-backend|Fullstack challenge

###### Installing: 
You must have installed nodejs-10 and npm.

Use `npm install` to install all dependencies.

###### Tests:
Once installed you can use `npm test` to execute all the tests for routing.

###### Running:
To run the server use `npm start`, it should display this `PayvisionBackendServer is running at 3000`.

This repo doesn't contain frontend source code which you can find [here](https://github.com/seirius/free-folk-renderer). 
If you already have the page compiled, you just need to place it at "web-dist" directory (Example: '/your-home/payvision-backend/web-dist/index.html').


###### Docker:
If you got a docker ready machine you can just run the image "seirius/payvision-challenge:v0" (docker run -p 80:3000 seirius/payvision-challenge:v0) and you got the web running at http://localhost.
